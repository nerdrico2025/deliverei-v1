## Requirements & Test Cases

### Storefront Authentication
- Test ID: `TC001`
- Name: User Login with Valid Credentials
- Status: ❌ Failed
- Visualization: https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/f0d02b2f-e779-4419-a094-fd6a45936eab/4e699b4f-28ee-4fa8-ae28-e446f706f43c
- Observed:
  - No JWT token or tenant slug persisted.
  - No redirection to storefront after login.
  - No error message visible when login fails.
- Likely Causes:
  - Backend API unreachable or incorrect `VITE_API_URL` during preview.
  - Slug not present or not resolved at time of request in test run.
  - Error shape not matching UI assumptions; fallback message not rendered.
- Code References:
  - `src/contexts/ClientAuthContext.tsx`: persists `tenantSlug` and client tokens to `localStorage` in `login()`.
  - `src/services/apiClient.ts`: injects `Authorization` and `X-Tenant-Slug` via axios interceptors.
  - `src/pages/storefront/ClientLogin.tsx`: handles login, redirects, and error rendering.
- Recommendations:
  - Verify `VITE_API_URL` points to a reachable backend in preview.
  - Ensure `slug` is set before the first login call; add a defensive check.
  - Add robust fallback error rendering on network/auth failures.

### Admin Dashboard Analytics
- Test ID: `TC008`
- Name: Admin Dashboard Displays Accurate Sales Metrics
- Status: ❌ Failed
- Visualization: https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/mcp/tests/f0d02b2f-e779-4419-a094-fd6a45936eab/40b03fee-1b3b-4050-a3bf-5adcd2e10ac7
- Observed:
  - Admin login succeeds, dashboard renders empty (no charts/data).
  - No date filters found, no error messages shown.
- Likely Causes:
  - Metrics endpoints not reachable from preview environment.
  - Silent failure when data fetch returns error/empty payload.
- Code References:
  - `src/services/dashboardApi.ts` and `src/pages/admin/*` for metrics fetching and UI.
  - `src/services/apiClient.ts` interceptors for tokens/slug.
- Recommendations:
  - Validate metrics API connectivity and auth in preview.
  - Add loading/empty/error states for charts and lists.
  - Consider mocked data fallback for non-production tests.

## Coverage Summary
- Total tests: 2
- Passed: 0
- Failed: 2

| Requirement Group            | Total | ✅ Passed | ❌ Failed |
|-----------------------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Storefront Authentication    | 1     | 0        | 1        |
| Admin Dashboard Analytics    | 1     | 0        | 1        |

## Findings & Recommendations
- Ensure `apiClient` base URL (`VITE_API_URL`) resolves and is reachable in preview.
- Confirm `X-Tenant-Slug` is available before any authenticated request; persist slug early from route.
- Strengthen error handling in `ClientLogin` and dashboard views to display user feedback on failures.
- Add deterministic mocks (or a mock backend) for CI/testing environments where real backend isn’t available.

## Next Actions
- Validate preview environment endpoints, credentials, and slug handling end-to-end.
- Implement error-boundary and empty-state components for dashboard metrics.
- Add integration test scaffolding with mock responses for critical flows.
